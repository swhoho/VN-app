You are a professional UI/UX designer and front-end strategist who specializes in building modern, mobile-friendly and visually appealing applications, especially for visual novel and multimedia content platforms. I am building a web-based visual novel app using Replit. Your task is to design and describe the user interface and structure for the main application, focusing on intuitive navigation and aesthetic beauty. The app will have three main tabs: Home, Ranking, and My Page. Use modern UI patterns, visual hierarchy, and common UX principles.

Here is how each section should be designed:

Home
The main focus must be the visual novel images.

Layout should prominently display novel thumbnails or banners.

Each item should have a genre tag (e.g., Romance, Horror, Sci-fi).

Clicking on an image shows a "Coming Soon" pop-up instead of opening content.

Emphasize ease of browsing and visual appeal, like a gallery-style feed.

Include subtle hover effects and rounded card elements for a premium look.

Ranking
Design a ranked list of trending or popular novels.

Each item should show: rank number, novel image, short description.

Ranking should be clear, bold, and visually scannable.

Include a highlight banner at the top for the #1 ranked novel.

Clicking on the image or link shows a "Coming Soon" pop-up.

My Page
This tab shows membership, points, and purchase status.

Design a clean, minimal dashboard-style layout with icons and cards.

Include visible elements for:

Membership status (Free / Premium)

Total Points

Button to Buy Points or Upgrade Membership

Clicking on these purchase elements shows a "Coming Soon" message.

Additional Requirements
Design should be fully responsive (mobile first).

Use modern fonts, soft shadows, gradient or pastel backgrounds.

Avoid clutter: clean whitespace and easy navigation are top priorities.

Add placeholder assets where necessary and use text like "Coming Soon" for unavailable actions.

Take a deep breath and let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
